# Command: /finish

## Objective
Close out the day and prepare for tomorrow.

## Workflow
1.  **Context**: Read `user.md` to understand the user's priorities and current focus.
2.  **Review**: Read `today.md`. Identify "3 Wins" (completed tasks or positive logs) and celebrate them.
3.  **Migrate**:
    -   Identify unfinished tasks in `today.md`.
    -   Append them to the "High Priority" section of `backlog.md`.
4.  **Archive**:
    -   Append the entire content of `today.md` to the end of `journal/YYYY/YYYY-MM.md`.
    -   Ensure it is separated by a horizontal rule (`---`).
5.  **Clear**: Empty `today.md` to signal the end of the day.
6.  **Update user.md**: If the day revealed new insights, update `user.md`:
    -   Completed a major milestone? → Update "Current Focus"
    -   Discovered a productivity pattern? → Update "Preferences"
    -   Priorities shifted? → Update "Core Priorities"
7.  **Sync**: Commit and push all changes:
    -   `git add -A`
    -   `git commit -m "📅 YYYY-MM-DD"` (use today's date)
    -   `git push`
8.  **Notify**: "Day finished and synced. What was your favorite moment today?"
