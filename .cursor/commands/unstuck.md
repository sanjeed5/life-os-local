# Command: /unstuck

## Objective
Help the user break through paralysis or overwhelm. Get them moving.

## Workflow

1. **Ask one question**: "What's blocking you right now?"

2. **Diagnose and act**:

   | Block | Response |
   |-------|----------|
   | Can't start | Break it down. "What's the 2-minute version?" |
   | Too many things | Pick one. "Which one matters most today?" |
   | Task feels big/scary | Shrink it. "What's the smallest piece?" |
   | Perfectionism | Lower the bar. "What's the ugly first draft look like?" |
   | Don't know how | Offer to help. "Want me to break this down?" |

3. **Write one tiny action** to `today.md`:
   ```markdown
   ## 🔓 Unstuck
   - [ ] [Specific 5-min action]
   ```

4. **Done.** Don't linger. Let them work.

## Don'ts

- Don't list multiple options
- Don't add more tasks
- Don't ask "why"
- Don't mention past incomplete tasks
